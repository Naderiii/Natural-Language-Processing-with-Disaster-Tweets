# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets

This repo contains an approach I implemented for the Disaster Tweets competition on Kaggle. This challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to start with Natural Language Processing, and Kaggle in general. You can access the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)



## About the Competition

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine-learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand-classified.

## Data

Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:

- The `text` of a tweet
- A `keyword` from that tweet (although this may be blank!)
- The `location` the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)

### Files
- **train.csv** - the training set
- **test.csv** - the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Columns
- `id` - a unique identifier for each tweet
- `text` - the text of the tweet
- `location` - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)
- `keyword` - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)
- `target` - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)
